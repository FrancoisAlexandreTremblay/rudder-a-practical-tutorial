# A step-by-step guide to applying RUDDER
In this [tutorial](tutorial.ipynb) I will show you how RUDDER can be applied step by step and how a reward redistribution model can be implemented using PyTorch.

You may use it as a quick-guide to apply RUDDER in your RL setting and to pre-assess if RUDDER might lead to improvements for your task beforehand.
This code should be runnable on common CPUs in reasonable time.

Links to further RUDDER code, our [blog](https://www.jku.at/index.php?id=16426), and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07857) can be found at our [RUDDER repo](https://github.com/ml-jku/rudder).
